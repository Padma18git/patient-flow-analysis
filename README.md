# Patient-Flow Analysis
Healthcare operations teams often manage fragmented patient data from referrals, admissions, facility capacity, and discharge systems. This project consolidates those sources into a unified dataset and produces actionable operational insights.

Key objectives:

Clean and validate patient operations data.

Standardize tables across referrals, admissions, discharges, demographics, and capacity.

Build a relational schema for storage and querying.

Perform SQL-based trend and performance analysis.

Develop interactive dashboards for operational tracking.

Generate insights to support patient flow, placement efficiency, and resource usage.
